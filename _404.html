  Whatever you hoped you were going to get when you asked for this particular
  URL, it is not here. We may have removed some old cruft and hope that you
  will find your way to the new content instead, you may have pasted a bad URL
  or we may have screwed up somewhere when we edited content on the site.
  We just cannot tell.

<p>
  A humble suggestion is that you start over on
  the <a href="https://curl.se/">main page</a> and go from there.

<p>
  Alternatively, enter some interesting search terms on our
  <a href="/search.html">search page</a>
  to find a more suitable destination on the curl site.
