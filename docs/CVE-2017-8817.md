FTP wildcard out of bounds read
===============================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 29th 2017 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2017-8817.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a read out of bounds flaw in the FTP wildcard function.

libcurl's FTP wildcard matching feature, which is enabled with the
`CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` option can use a built-in wildcard function or a user
provided one. The built-in wildcard function has a flaw that makes it not
detect the end of the pattern string if it ends with an open bracket (`[`) but
instead it continues reading the heap beyond the end of the URL buffer that
holds the wildcard.

For applications that use HTTP(S) URLs, allow libcurl to handle redirects and
have FTP wildcards enabled, this flaw can be triggered by malicious servers
that can redirect clients to a URL using such a wildcard pattern.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2017-8817 to this issue.

CWE-126: Buffer Over-read

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.21.0 to and including 7.56.1
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.21.0 and >= 7.57.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0825cd80a62c

curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.

SOLUTION
------------

In libcurl version 7.57.0, there is a better check for the end of the
string. Additionally, the wildcard feature is turned off if the URL passed to
libcurl is not using FTP(S), so a redirect to an FTP URL cannot trigger
wildcard functionality.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0b664ba968437715819b

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.57.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

 C - Do not use `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` without carefully verifying the
     patterns used.

TIMELINE
---------

It was reported to the curl project on November 10, 2017. We contacted
distros@openwall on November 21.

curl 7.57.10 was released on November 29 2017, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
