TITLE(CA certificates extracted from Mozilla)
<div class="relatedbox">
<b>Related:</b>
<br><a href="sslcerts.html">SSL Certs</a>
</div>

<p>
 The Mozilla CA certificate store in PEM format (around 200KB uncompressed):

<p>
 <big><a href="../ca/cacert.pem">cacert.pem</a></big>

<p>
  This bundle was generated at <b> CA_DATE </b>.

<p>
 This PEM file contains the datestamp of the conversion and we only make a new
 conversion if there is a change in either the script or the source file. This
 service checks for updates every day. Here's
 the <a href="../ca/cacert.pem.sha256">sha256sum</a> of the current PEM file.

SUBTITLE(filename)
<p>
 Some programs will expect this file to be named <tt>ca-bundle.crt</tt> (in
 the correct path). curl on windows has a system to find it if
 named <tt>curl-ca-bundle.crt</tt>.

SUBTITLE(CA file revisions per date of appearance)
<p><ul>
#include "../ca/pemlist.gen"
</ul>

SUBTITLE(Missing Name Constraints)
<p>
  The converted PEM file only contains the digital signatures for CAs. Several
of those CAs have constraints in Firefox (and other browsers) to only be
allowed for certain domains and other similar additional conditions. Those
constraints are thus <b>not</b> brought along in this cacert file!

SUBTITLE(CA certificate store license)
<p>
 The PEM file is only a converted version of the original one and thus it is
 licensed under the same license as the Mozilla source file: MPL 2.0

SUBTITLE(Automated downloads from here)
<p>
 We do not mind you downloading the PEM file from us in an automated fashion.

<p>
 A suitable curl command line to only download it when it has changed:
<pre>
  curl <a href="/docs/manpage.html#--etag-compare">--etag-compare</a> etag.txt <a href="/docs/manpage.html#--etag-save">--etag-save</a> etag.txt <a href="/docs/manpage.html#-O">--remote-name</a> https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem
</pre>

Or if you use an ancient curl version that does not support etags:
<pre>
  curl <a href="/docs/manpage.html#-O">--remote-name</a> <a href="/docs/manpage.html#-z">--time-cond</a> cacert.pem https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem
</pre>

SUBTITLE(The conversion script mk-ca-bundle)
<p>
 The <a href="mk-ca-bundle.html">mk-ca-bundle</a> tool
 converts <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>'s certificate store
 to PEM format, suitable for (lib)curl and others.

SUBTITLE(Convert from your local Firefox installation)

<p> You can also extract the ca certs off your Firefox installation, if you
 just have the 'certutil' tool installed and run
 the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/scripts/firefox-db2pem.sh">firefox-db2pem.sh</a>
 script!
