<p>
Free and Open Source Software projects have a long tradition of forks and
duplicate efforts. We enjoy "doing it ourselves", no matter if someone else
has done something very similar already.

<p>
 Alternative libraries that cover parts of libcurl's features, in A-Z order:

<p>

<b><a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/beast">Beast</a></b> (Boost)
<ul><li>
  Beast is a C++ header-only library serving as a foundation for writing
  interoperable networking libraries by providing low-level HTTP/1, WebSocket,
  and networking protocol vocabulary types and algorithms using the consistent
  asynchronous model of Boost.Asio.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://docs.libcpr.org/">CPR</a></b> (MIT)
<ul><li>
  C++ Requests: Curl for People, a spiritual port of Python Requests. (based on libcurl)
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://www.berlios.de/software/kasablanca/">ftplib++</a></b> (GPL)
<ul><li>
 A C++ library for "easy FTP client functionality. It features resuming of up-
 and downloads, FXP support, SSL/TLS encryption, and logging functionality."
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/commoncpp/">GNU Common C++ library</a></b>
<ul><li>
Has a URLStream class. This C++ class allow you to download a file using HTTP.
See demo/urlfetch.cpp in commoncpp2-1.3.19.tar.gz
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libfetch/">libfetch</a></b> (BSD)<br>
<ul><li>
 Does HTTP and FTP transfers (both ways), supports file: URLs, and an API for
 URL parsing. The utility <i>fetch</i> that is built on libfetch is an
 integral part of the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> operating
 system.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://www.w3.org/Library/">libwww</a></b> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">W3C license</a>) <a href="libwww.html">comparison with libcurl</a> <br>
<ul><li>
  (<b>Not used anymore</b>) More complex and harder to use than libcurl
  is. Includes everything from multi-threading to HTML parsing. The most
  notable transfer-related feature that libcurl does not offer but libwww
  does, is caching.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://live.gnome.org/LibSoup">libsoup</a></b> (LGPL)<br>
<ul><li>

 Part of glib (GNOME).
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://notroj.github.io/neon/">neon</a></b> (LGPL) <a href="neon.html">comparison with neon</a> <br>
<ul><li>
  An HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. I have mainly heard
  and seen people use this with WebDAV as their main interest. This is one
  of the two alternatives used by the Subversion project.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://pocoproject.org/docs/">POCO C++ Libraries</a></b> (Boost)
<ul><li>
  a collection of open source C++ class libraries that simplify and accelerate
  the development of network-centric, portable applications in C++.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtnetwork-programming.html">Qt Networking</a></b> (GPL/LGPL)<br>
<ul><li>
  The Qt Network module offers classes that allow you to write TCP/IP clients
  and servers, including "High Level" network operations for HTTP and FTP.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://serf.apache.org/">Serf</a></b> (Apache License)
<ul><li>
  <i>"The serf library is a C-based HTTP client library built upon the Apache
  Portable Runtime (APR) library. It multiplexes connections, running the
  read/write communication asynchronously."</i>  This is one
  of the two alternatives used by the Subversion project.
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul><li>
  While not a library at all, I have been told that people sometimes extract the
  network code from it and base their own hacks from there.
</li></ul>

<b><a
href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa385483.aspx">wininet</a></b> <a
href="wininet.html">comparison with libcurl</a><br>

<ul><li>
  <i>"The Windows Internet (WinINet) application programming interface (API)
  enables applications to interact with Gopher, FTP, and HTTP protocols to
  access Internet resources."</i>
</li></ul>

<b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/xmlsdk30/htm/xmobjxmlhttprequest.asp">XMLHTTP Object</a></b> also known as IXMLHTTPRequest (part of MSXML 3.0)<br>
<ul><li>
 (Windows) Provides client-side protocol support for communication with HTTP
 servers. A client computer can use the XMLHTTP object to send an arbitrary
 HTTP request, receive the response, and have the MicrosoftÂ® XML Document
 Object Model (DOM) parse that response.
</li></ul>

<p>
 Have <b>you</b> tried programming with one of the other libs and care share
your experiences? We'd love to make this collection more complete and feature
lengthier comments about each lib.
