 These are only some quick notes. If you have additional experiencies and
comments you want to share with the world, we are all ears!

<ul>

 <li> libcurl is (far) more portable

 <li> libcurl is supported and has a living community (compare traffic on the
 mailing lists, release frequency or similar)

 <li> programs need less code to transfer files using libcurl than a libwww-
 based equivalent

 <li> libcurl is thread-safe, libwww is not

 <li> libcurl has a different feature-set and offers several features not
 present in libwww, like several HTTP authentication types and gzip support

 <li> libcurl supports more protocols

 <li> libwww offers caching and HTML parsing, which libcurl does not

</ul>

Having used both, I would recommend libcurl and definitely not libwww.
<p>
libcurl is easy to use and gives good performance. libwww is a nightmare to
use, performs poorly (no overlapped I/O support, for example), and is
practically undocumented (on top of which it is a very complex library).
libwww is really a platform for network protocol development, not a library
for basic access to well known network protocol stacks.

I devoted a full man-month trying to understand libwww, writing a function of
intermediate complexity (supporting post requests, xml parsing, authentication
etc.)  and figuring out that the problems I encountered were due to libwww and
not my code.
<p>
I switched to libcurl, rewrote the same code in a week and have not
looked back.
<p>
Perhaps this library has some features that libcurl does not, though I did not
have to use them for my needs. However, for libwww to survive, someone has to
focus on these features and let libcurl do the rest.
<p>
Personally, I cannot find any reason to suggest libwww to anyone.
