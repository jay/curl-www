 In the curl project we use git for source code control.

TITLE(<b>Browse</b> the Sources)
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">Browse the source repository</a> (on github.com)

TITLE(<b>Get</b> the Sources)
<p>
  The curl sources are kept in a git repository. You can get the most recent
  curl source files from there at any time. git is the version control system
  we use for the curl project. All files in the release archive that are not
  generated from other files are kept there, to allow full backtracking of
  older versions. To use git you need a git client, get yours
  from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>. Windows users might
  fancy <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">git for Windows</a>.
<p>
  This is mostly a feature for you who really want to have a peek in how the
  current development version looks like, and not if you just want to download
  a version to run. If you just want to download a tar or binary
  archive, <a href="/download.html">go here</a>.
<p>
  If you want to use the git server, run:
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git
</pre>

 <b>Note</b> that this will create a curl subdirectory.
<p>
  If you at a later time want to get the updated set of files, just cd into
  this directory and run
<pre>
  git pull
</pre>
#if 0
<p>
  If a proxy, firewall or something else is preventing you from using git to
  get the latest sources, you can get the sources off the repo using HTTPS
  like:
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git
</pre>
#endif
 You can also opt to download a <a
 href="https://curl.se/snapshots/">daily snapshot</a>.

TITLE(<b>Compile and Build</b> the Sources)
<p>
 When you checkout the sources, you get a file
 named <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/GIT-INFO.md">GIT-INFO.md</a>
 in the source root that describes how to proceed to compile and build them.

TITLE(<b>Change</b> the Sources)
<p>
 If you are about to do a lot of modifications, discuss it on the curl or
 libcurl mailing list in advance and please consider to use git directly to do
 the changes and provide the necessary patches back to the project!

<p>
 When you do your changes, commit them properly with git using appropriate
 commit messages and all. Then when you have something to show (and do show us
 early and often) generate either a pull-request on github or plain old
 patches and send to the mailing list.
