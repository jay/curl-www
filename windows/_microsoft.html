<p>
 On December 19
 2017, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20171219-tar-and-curl-come-to-windows">Microsoft
 announced</a> that since insider build 17063 of Windows 10, curl is a default
 component.

SUBTITLE(Windows 10/11 bundle curl)
<p>
 All installs of Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 get curl installed by
 default since then.
<p>
 The Microsoft provided version is built to use the Schannel TLS backend.
 Invoking curl -V after the June 2024 update shows this on these
 platforms:
<p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: keep-all">
curl 8.7.1 (Windows) libcurl/8.7.1 Schannel zlib/1.3 WinIDN
Release-Date: 2024-03-27
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp
Features: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI threadsafe Unicode UnixSockets
</pre>

SUBTITLE(Omissions)
<p>
  The build Microsoft ships omits several good features:
<ul>
  <li> it has no Public Suffic List (PSL) support, making it impossible to prevent "super cookies"
  <li> it does not support HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
  <li> it only supports a limited set of protocols (no SCP, SFTP, etc)
</ul>

SUBTITLE(Separate)
<p>
 The curl tool shipped with Windows is built by and handled by Microsoft. It
 is a separate build that will have different features and capabilities
 enabled and disabled compared to the <a href="/windows/">Windows builds</a>
 offered by the curl project. They do however build curl from the same source
 code. If you have problems with their curl version, report that to them.
<p>
 You can probably assume that the curl packages from Microsoft will always lag
 behind the versions provided by the curl project itself.

SUBTITLE(A Powershell alias)
<p>
 The curl tool comes installed <i>in addition to</i> the
 dreaded <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/19/removing-the-powershell-curl-alias/">curl
 alias</a> that plagues Powershell users since it is an alias that runs the
 invoke-webrequest command and therefore is not acting much like curl at all.
<p>
 A work-around is to invoke curl as "curl.exe" to prevent powershell from
 treating it as an alias.
